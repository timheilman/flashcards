todo: get sowpods out of git; have build process start from binary


blocker: process before had edits to a copy of sowpods as part of
processing edits were mainly 1) hints for inflection membership
memorization, fixable by trusting complete set of expected inflections
are listed, or else not-worrying-about-it, 2) inflection lists not
correctly including inflections (-S) of whole-word inflections,
fixable by the ABAMPS todo, and 3) some additional def'ns, fixable by
putting them into their own resources file.

todo: feature-make it easy to configure: I don't care about enable1 but I want sowpods in output
todo: feature-add sowpods
todo: feature-make cloze cards for inflection categories
todo: feature-heuristic to include ABAMPS in sowpods_dict_words: check other whole-word inflections for the missing S
